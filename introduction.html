      <li>Skin cancer is the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells in the epidermis, the outermost skin layer, caused
        by unrepaired D.N.A. damage that triggers mutations.</li>
      <li>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (C.D.C.), skin cancer is the most common cancer in
        the United States. </li>
      <li>Conventionally, the first step of skin cancer diagnosis is the visual examination of a dermatologist, which
        could result in low accuracy. </li>
      <li>Therefore, the twofold demand for a better skin cancer detection mechanism is straightforward. </li>
      <li>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are used to find better solutions for tasks in medical image
        analysis, e.g., rehabilitation training analysis, breast cancer classification and skin cancer detection. </li>
      <li>This work compared the performances of three CNN models, namely VGG16, VGG19, and a self-designed model, in
        the classification task of nine categories of skin cancers.</li>
      <li>Based on their performances, the model with the highest accuracy is integrated into a web application.</li>
