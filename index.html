    <p class="abstracttext"> Skin cancer is a very common form of cancer that jeopardizes people's health. Like other
      cancers,
      early detection is crucial to its treatment. However, traditional methods for diagnosing skin cancer
      can be low in accuracy and often leads to unnecessary examination. In addition, some existing Machine
      Learning models for skin cancer detection can be limited as well for the small number of skin cancer
      categories they support. In this work, three types of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are
      compared on a nine-class skin cancer classification task and the model with the highest accuracy is
      integrated into a web application. The three CNN models that are compared include VGG-16, VGG-19, and
      a self-designed network. Since the three models differ in their depth, the relationship between the
      depth and performance of a model within the scope of the dataset used was also explored. Test results
      showed that the most accurate model is VGG-19, which achieved 0.9290 in accuracy and 1.2842 in loss,
      making it a reliable method to assist skin cancer detection.</p>
